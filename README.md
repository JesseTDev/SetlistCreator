<h1>Setlist Creator App</h1>

Setlist Creator
Setlist Creator is a web application that allows users to create and manage setlists for music performances. Users can create a setlist by adding songs one by one, and can also save the setlist as a PDF document for printing. 


<h2>How to Use</h2>
Create a Setlist
To create a new setlist, enter a name for the setlist in the "Setlist Name" input field, then click the "+" button. You can then add songs to the setlist one at a time by entering the song name in the "Song Names" input field and clicking the "+" button.

<h2>Save Setlist as PDF</h2>
Once you have created a setlist, you can save it as a PDF document by clicking the "Save as PDF" button. This will open a new tab in your browser with the setlist as a PDF document, which you can then save or print as needed.

<h2>Clear Setlist</h2>
To clear the current setlist and start over, click the "Clear Setlist" button. This will remove all songs from the current setlist and allow you to create a new one from scratch. 
You can also remove a song that you want to replace or do not want on the setlist by clicking the minus red remove button.
